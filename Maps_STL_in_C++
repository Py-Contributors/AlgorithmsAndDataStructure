Maps are associative containers that store elements in a mapped fashion. Each element has a key value and a mapped value. 
No two mapped values can have same key values.

Some basic functions associated with Map:
begin() – Returns an iterator to the first element in the map
end() – Returns an iterator to the theoretical element that follows last element in the map
size() – Returns the number of elements in the map
max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the map can hold
empty() – Returns whether the map is empty
pair insert(keyvalue, mapvalue) – Adds a new element to the map
erase(iterator position) – Removes the element at the position pointed by the iterator
erase(const g)– Removes the key value ‘g’ from the map
clear() – Removes all the elements from the map
