Unbounded Knapsack Implementation in Python 3+

Weight arr: consists of the items weights
Profit arr: consists of the profit of items
Capacity:  Capacity of Sack
Time Complexity:- O(Capacity * number of items) = O(N^2)
Space Comlexity:- O(Capacity * number of items) = O(N^2)

>>> knapsack = UnboundedKnapsack()
