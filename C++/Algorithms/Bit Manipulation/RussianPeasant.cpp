/*Russian Reasant Algorithm

In this algorithm, two numbers are multiplied without using multiplication operator.
We double the first number and halve the second number repeatedly till the second number doesnâ€™t become 1. 
In the process, whenever the second number becomes odd, we add the first number to result.
