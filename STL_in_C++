The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and 
functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. 
It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.
