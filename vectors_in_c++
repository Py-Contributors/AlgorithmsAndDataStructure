Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted,
with their storage being handled automatically by the container. Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that 
they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes
differential time, as sometimes there may be a need of extending the array.
