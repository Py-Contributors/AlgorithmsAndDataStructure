C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. 
It is an imperative and a compiled language.C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels)
and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.
